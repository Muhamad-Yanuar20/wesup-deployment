-- Repair remote schema drift: the base restore migration (20260909050000) is
-- recorded as applied but its INSERT/DELETE policies on storage.objects are
-- absent in the deployed project (only the product SELECT policy survives).
-- This forward migration re-establishes supplier-product upload and delete
-- capabilities without touching the SELECT path.
